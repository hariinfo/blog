## Synopsis
As I get close to two decades in the IT field, my love for coding is still alive. Unfortunately, with career growth in this field (_As you move to a technology leadership role_), you also do lesser coding by the day.
Although there are many reasons to be hands-on, I believe the following are my three top reasons why I gravitate towards coding.

<b>First</b>, Do you want to have a practical vs. theoretical understanding of a concept?. Learning is one thing, but practicing what you learn gives you a ton of confidence when talking about technology to a broader audience.

<b>Second</b>, Problem solvers are achievers. I have always felt a sense of achievement as I solve a problem through coding. I guess this sense can only be realized when you get your hands dirty with code.

<b>Lastly</b>, It makes you feel young!! :). The community of coders is vibrant, energetic, and constantly unlearning old things to learn new technology trends. 

So what am I going to do about this? Although, my primary job responsibility does not require me to code anymore. I have decided to stay up to date by spinning up a few repositories of my favorite technologies. I choose to use these work-in-progress repositories and augment these starter projects over time with new tools in my quest for learning.

For now, I would like to start with a repo of Spring Boot Starter [https://github.com/hariinfo/spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/hariinfo/spring-boot-starter).

For the rest of 2022, I plan to learn at least one front end (Eyeing [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) in this space) and mobile stack (Eyeing [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) here)

Thats all for the new year resolution. Happy coding !!!.
